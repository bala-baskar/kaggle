Data sampling is an important process in the journey of data analysts. As sampling involves collecting a portion of the population, we evaluate whether this small portion of data (sample) represents the population data, so that our analysis will be made with less cost and less time-consuming.

**Population** - Every possible individual element that we are interested in measuring.
**Sample** - A portion of the population.

To collect this sample from the population, there are various methods used, as follows:

### Probability Sampling Methods
**Simple random sample** - Every member of a population has an equal chance of being selected to be in the sample. Randomly select members through the use of a random number generator or some means of random selection. Simple random samples are usually representative of the population we’re interested in since every member has an equal chance of being included in the sample.

**Stratified random sample** - Split a population into groups. Randomly select some members from each group to be in the sample. Stratified random samples ensure that members from each group in the population are included in the survey.

**Cluster random sample** - Split a population into clusters. Randomly select some of the clusters and include all members from those clusters in the sample. Cluster random samples get every member from some of the groups, which is useful when each group is reflective of the population as a whole.

**Systematic random sample** -  Put every member of a population into some order. Choosing a random starting point and selecting every nth member to be in the sample. Systematic random samples are usually representative of the population we’re interested in since every member has an equal chance of being included in the sample.

### Non-probability Sampling Methods
This method applies that not every member of a population has an equal probability of being selected to be in the sample. This type of sampling method is sometimes used because it’s much cheaper and more convenient compared to probability sampling methods. It’s often used during exploratory analysis when researchers simply want to gain an initial understanding of a population.
However, the samples that result from these sampling methods cannot be used to draw inferences about the populations they came from because they typically aren’t representative samples.

**Convenience sample** - Choose members of a population that are readily available to be included in the sample. For example, a researcher stands in front of a library during the day and polls people that happen to walk by. The drawback with this method is Location and time of day will affect the results. More than likely, the sample will suffer from undercoverage bias since certain people (e.g. those who work during the day) will not be represented as much in the sample.

**Voluntary response sample** -  A researcher puts out a request for volunteers to be included in a study and members of a population voluntarily decide to be included in the sample or not. For example, a radio host asks listeners to go online and take a survey on his website. The drawback with this method is People who voluntarily respond will likely have stronger opinions (positive or negative) than the rest of the population, which makes them an unrepresentative sample. Using this sampling method, the sample is likely to suffer from nonresponse bias – certain groups of people are simply less likely to provide responses.

**Snowball sample** - Researchers recruit initial subjects to be in a study and then ask those initial subjects to recruit additional subjects to be in the study. Using this approach, the sample size “snowballs” bigger and bigger as each additional subject recruits more subjects.
For example, researchers are conducting a study of individuals with rare diseases, but it’s difficult to find individuals who actually have the disease. However, if they can find just a few initial individuals to be in the study then they can ask them to recruit further individuals they may know through a private support group or through some other means.	
But the drawback with this method is sampling bias is likely to occur. Because initial subjects recruit additional subjects, it’s likely that many of the subjects will share similar traits or characteristics that might be unrepresentative of the larger population under study. Thus, findings from the sample can’t be extrapolated to the population.

**Purposive sample** - Researchers recruit individuals based on who they think will be most useful based on the purpose of their study.
For example, researchers want to know about the opinions that individuals in a city have about a potential new rock climbing gym being placed in the city square so they purposely seek out individuals that hang out at other rock climbing gyms around the city.
But the drawback of this method is the individuals in the sample are unlikely to be representative of the overall population. Thus, findings from the sample can’t be extrapolated to the population
