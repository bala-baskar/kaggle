**Factors that affect the size of Correlation (r)**

The correlation is the statistic measure that describes the size and direction of the linear relationship between two continuous variables and ranges in the value between -1.0 (perfect negative relationship) to +1.0 (perfect positive relationship), if 0.0 then there is no linear relationship between the variables.

The commonly used correlation statistic is Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, with the given formula :

$$ r_{xy} = {S_{xy}  \over (S_x * S_y)} $$

Another commonly presented formula is using z scores of both the variables : 

$$ r_{xy} = {\sum Z_x * Z_y  \over n} $$

An unexpectedly low correlation might be explained by one or more factors that affect the size of r but most of the time it is mistaken that there is no relationship between the variables of interest. There are 6 factors that are to be considered which can affect the size of r. It is always important to identify whether one of these factors influences the low value of r, before concluding that the variables don't have a linear relationship.

Following are the 6 factors that affects the size of r:
**1. The amount of variability in either variable**
**2. Differences in the shape of the two distributions**
**3. Lack of linearity in the relationship between the 2 variables**
**4. Presence of one or more outliers**
**5. Characteristics of the sample used for the calculation of the correlation**
**6. Measurement error**

**1. Amount of Variability in X or Y**
	If other things are equal, the value of r will be greater if there is more variability among the observation than if there is less variability.

**2. Shape of distributions**
	The correlation can reach its maximum value of 1.0 (positive or negative), only if the shapes of distributions in both the variables are the same. The extent of shape dissimilarity can be shown by the lack of similarity in skewness and kurtosis. The more dissimilar the shape is, the lower the maximum value of r can be found.

**3. Lack of linearity**
	If the actual relationship between X and Y is not linear, rather if it is a curvilinear or nonlinear relationship, the value of r will be very low and even closer to zero. If the relation is not considered to be linear, there is an alternate metric used - correlation ratio as the suitable correlation coefficient - it measures the relationship between the two variables, regardless of the form of relationship (linear or nonlinear)

**4. Presence of one or more Outliers**
	An outlier's effect is greater in a small dataset than in a larger one. The presence of an outlier in a dataset can result in an increase or decrease in the size of the correlation, depending on the location of an outlier.

**5. Characteristics of the sample**
	Unique characteristics of a sample can affect the size of r. Most of the time, these characteristics overlap with one or more of the other situations already discussed - truncated range, presence of outliers, skewed data. Thus, sample selection can affect the strength of relationships calculated with correlations.

**6. Measurement error**
	Measurement error, which decreases the reliability of the measures of the variables, can be attributed to a variety of sources - interindividual factors (fatigue, anxiety, guessing, etc), administrative factors, scoring errors, environmental factors, the ambiguity of questions, too few questions and so on.

We should start asking the below questions when the correlation value is low:
1. Is there a lack of variability in the data?
2. Do the marginal distributions have dissimilar shapes?
3. Is there a nonlinear or curvilinear relationship between the two variables?
4. Are there one or more outliers in the dataset?
5. Are there other unique characteristics of the sample that might be responsible for an unusually low value of r?
6. Is the measurement reliability for either or both variables low?

To detect the factors, need to do the following:
**1. Scatter diagram** - helps to identify lack of variability, lack of linearity, or the presence of outliers
**2. Descriptive statistics like standard deviation, skewness** - helps to identify the lack of variability and dissimilar distribution shapes
**3. Description of samples and sampling methods** - helps to identify the special characteristics of the sample
**4. Reliability coefficients** - the possibility of attenuated correlation due to measurement error
            (Reliability - ratio of true score variance to observed score variance)
            (attenuated correlation - reduction in the size of r due to measurement error
