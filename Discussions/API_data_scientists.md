**What is an API?**

An Application Programming Interface (API) allows pieces of code to interact with one another. Developers use APIs to build their websites with specific features, like a Google Maps interface, instead of having to write code from scratch. Some may be open-source, while others charge a fee for implementation. You typically need to register a developer account or have some other means of authentication for APIs. 
An API typically has three core elements:
- **Access:** Who is the user accessing the service?
- **Request:** What is the service or data being requested? This includes both methods (what questions do you need answered with the data or service solicited?) and parameters (supplementary details).
- **Response:** How does the system respond to the request? 
Representational State Transfer (REST) provides a method for communication over web services, with commands like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE.
