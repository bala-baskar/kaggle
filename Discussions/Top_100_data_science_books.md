**51 - Dynamic Mode Decomposition Data-Driven Modeling of Complex Systems**
**Author - J. Nathan Kutz, Steven L. Brunton, Bingni W. Brunton, Joshua L. Proctor**
**Description-**Data-driven dynamical systems is a burgeoning field-it connects how measurements of nonlinear dynamical systems and/or complex systems can be used with well-established methods in dynamical systems theory. This is a critically important new direction because the governing equations of many problems under consideration by practitioners in various scientific fields are not typically known. Thus, using data alone to help derive, in an optimal sense, the best dynamical system representation of a given application allows for important new insights.

This potential for good, on the one hand, and harm, on the other, makes it essential to ask: Data science by whom? Data science for whom? Data science with whose interests in mind? The narratives around big data and data science are overwhelmingly white, male, and techno-heroic.
